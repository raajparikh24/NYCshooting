### Shooting incident in New york city from last three years.
Raj Parikh, Fall 2022, Command Line GIS.

The dataset was obtained from [Census](https://www.census.gov/), [EPA Smart Location Database](https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping) and [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)  for the year 2019,2020 and 2021. 

Jane Jacobs first proposed a notion in which walkability served to protect a neighborhood from criminal activities. 
Research question: Is the link between objective crime and walking influenced by a walkable neighborhood?

Based on the analysis, it seems that in new york city walkability index is moderately correlated with shooting incidents.

The main problem I came across was adding proportional symbols to the map.
